were to partake very well was the reply as they walked along toward s i will go with pleasure all the greater as it is twenty four hours since i tasted food to the exclamation which greeted this announcement the stranger added oh that is nothing if i were at liberty to tell you let me say only this i have been robbed my enemies have me and as you see they have left me in a rather disagreeable plight but my courage is still good and when my turn comes i shall pay them back with interest what may i call you asked handing his new acquaintance his card as they seated them selves at one of the

the statement most astonishing he said he had heard some of the singing from a distance and had not taken the trouble to go nearer as for the sky he had not even noticed it except to on the

little of corn that cost three cents american money each and the result was so pleasant he wondered as he strolled back to his hotel on the grand canal why such a fuss was made over charity and why the least suffering was allowed to exist that evening he walked for some time in the the marble palaces that form three sides of the square were filled with a brilliant throng moving to and fro or

boasted such present possessions as he walked along he also noticed several rings of no small value on his companion s fingers and when the began to strike mr drew out an elegant gold watch with the

societies in which he has long taken an interest and this nephew he had never seen gray nodded you will of course use every effort to find him he said becoming a i shall take the usual means of doing so replied the lawyer but i may say frankly that i do not feel it my duty to send to the four quarters of the globe mr was a gentleman fairly well known in the commercial world his death abroad was by the news to the principal papers the public he has made have been mentioned in organs far and wide his portrait with a sketch of his career has already been arranged for in an illustrated magazine the

even by discussing a like the one suggested mr evidently meant to give this property to his sister s son and his wish must be considered sacred as for myself with what i now have and what i shall be

exactly what is your present standing he asked no replied gray but i presume you who have mr s accounts in your hands can tell me the lawyer bowed slowly two or three times i am afraid there is less

to be lost you are very kind to make the proposition but to this mr saying it was wholly a business matter with him and he wanted it treated as such he was willing to pay fifteen dollars a week with necessary expense of travel etc and possibly the salary might be raised to twenty later gray seized upon the offer without more and it was arranged that he should begin his duties the very next morning never having had the slightest business experience it is doubtful if the young man ever really earned the meagre salary which he began to receive but he brought to the work an honesty of purpose and a of conduct if mr had been wholly in him the connection might have gone on much longer than it did to the mutual advantage of both the fact was however that the engagement was only a scheme on the lawyer s part for bringing gray to the agreement he had first suggested mr believed thoroughly that this was the only sensible thing for him to do and felt that the obstinacy with which he held out deserved to be overcome if he could reduce the youth to actual want and then give him no other alternative than to accept his offer he believed he would be doing him a real kindness but

came to regard the which he took between nine and eleven as the most part of each day but as might have been foreseen one of the persons he met while engaged in this way was his old acquaintance well

him and would have kept up the to the end if had not finally his animal in front of him so as to completely bar the way at a point on the row where the two were nearly alone oh don t pretend not to

of the other was slowly rising he could not trust himself to make any reply lest hi temper should get the better of him and provoke a scene not to be desired so he whirled his animal about and galloped away without a single word he felt that he should do that man a mischief if getting thrown together and for the next he took his rides in s park to escape a disagreeable meeting about a fortnight from the time when he first went to live at mr apartments gray found seated with that gentleman one evening at a rather late hour an elderly man of and dejected mien who sat in the shadow of

this year to morrow there was a gasp that of alarm and then the youth into deep thought what could it mean something had not yet been told him there was some reason to marry a pretty girl with a fortune was not a fate men usually struggled to avoid nor was it necessary to a man into society on semi false to find one who would accept the hand of such a lady but to look at the other side of the question what would result from declining this offer simply to be turned out into the street with ten pounds advance wages in his pocket and starvation to face again it was clearly a case where a gift

in delicate health it might mean instant death to her father a man of the highest reputation and as jealous of his honor as one a blunt refusal can conceive it must be a blow compared to which there is no other conceivable he has brought her up delicately with the best of teachers as free apparently from danger of this kind as an angel in paradise her mother has been her most constant friend and the girl had never shown the least partiality for the opposite sex so far as they knew nevertheless the deed was done and when she went in terror to this father and told him the truth he came at once to me i being his legal adviser i have never seen a human being in such mental agony in spite of himself mr gray was listening and with the deepest interest to this remarkable story he began even to excuse the for the part he had taken in him into this net from which he would presently make good his escape aged ten years in one hour continued mr this old man told me as men tell things to lawyers and to priests of the curse that had fallen on his house as was my duty i tried to the effects of the injury by suggesting ways to lessen the force of the blow i said we could take the guilty one in

her than to own as a son in law a wretch who had such a crime against them he believed the fellow had proceeded deliberately with this expectation in view and had hoped to attain by to a position he could never reach in a straightforward and honest manner love gone astray the father disposed of him in one torrent of and i saw that further talk on that score was useless even had i thought from my

hours he announced his either his daughter should be taken to some secluded place and remain till the birth of her child which he would amply provide for or and this alternative he came to but slowly and by my suggestion she should marry some respectable man who had a full knowledge of her condition and accepted her accordingly in the latter case there must be arranged a pretended marriage of an

the past month a dream from which he must sooner or later awake while he felt keenly the position into which he had permitted himself to be drawn he accepted it as inevitable and would hardly have escaped if by one dash for freedom he could have done so the gentle of his bride impressed him strongly it was something to have brought relief to that distracted mind placed by fate in a condition where he was not the master of his own destiny it was well that he had been used as an instrument of mercy to others he resolved to make the best of his marriage and win whatever of credit there might remain in a union entered upon so the dinner that the domestic brought him was w tou must let me thank you fairly well treated for the appetite of youth is hard to destroy and the injury to his ankle

with all possible as on the previous occasion mr only remained in the room long enough to make his and to say that he hoped the meeting would result agreeably to all parties concerned when he had gone colonel whose face gray now saw distinctly for the first time seated himself in an a little way from the couch he was an elderly man in years and a decidedly old man in appearance much older since the trouble in his family had no doubt there was a tired look about his gray eyes a in the movements of his hands that told its own tale he had a large quantity of hair that persistently fell across his forehead in a style that might at a former day have added to his good looks but was now a pathetic of the suffering he had undergone he was tall or had been for the stoop of the broad shoulders lowered his stature considerably his dress was careless and his voice naturally strong trembled there was a moment during which neither of them spoke and the clock at the other end of the room so loudly that both were aware of its sound then gray courage and thinking it the part of wisdom to set the conversation in the right direction at the beginning addressed his companion gone astray i want to say to you he began that i realize the feelings you must have towards me and hope you will do as little as possible to that point your daughter and i have committed an no doubt both of us feel it now altogether too plainly but at the time we decided to marry in last september neither foresaw the injurious effect of that course nothing remains for me but to ask your forgiveness and to live hereafter in such a manner that you will forget what has passed these things uttered not without many pauses and for the right expressions when he had finished unable to say another word he felt that he had himself very badly colonel listened at first with a look of wonder on his distressed face but gradually seemed to comprehend the which gray had elected to use when it became his turn to speak however he could not bring himself to take up the thread that was offered him his sentiments were too deep for all he could do was to confine himself to the future he knew very well that this man was not responsible for his daughter s fall he knew that the marriage between them was but a few hours old and that the of the documents was the fraud i have come here he began to assure you that i shall make the best of the situation and treat you sir as far as i can as if there was nothing peculiar in this affair if i am tempted to speak of of anything that i would have given my life to have had

said candidly but i have youth sir and courage and perhaps a little ability and i hope you will soon help me to some employment that will relieve me from the shame of idleness it was plain that these remarks were agreeable to colonel and that their effect was to lift in some small degree the cloud that hung upon his face he had begun already to like this young man we will talk of that in good time he said when i return to america which he paused a moment will not be for for a year or so something can be arranged at present however it is not to be thought of for you will have some some and some other duties i wish you to feel mr gray that you are now my son and that the greatest treasure he gasped that i own yes still the greatest treasure except my wife is in your hands while you give her the care and attention she needs at present i want you to think of nothing else when the love gone astray right time comes we will talk about it yes we will talk about it the rest of the time that colonel remained was passed in a general discussion of the manner in which the year should be passed and the two men found themselves in perfect accord i want to take your hand said the colonel as he rose to depart i wish you to feel that you have a friend who fully who is glad that a ray of good fortune that came with so much that was ill threw you in his way and i hope he added that you will

so abruptly into other fields that the took the plain hint and did not refer to the family again that night on the succeeding afternoon when mrs gray came to see her husband she brought tidings that the news had been broken to her mother and that she had received it as well as could possibly have been hoped mrs her child and when the case was presented with due by the colonel as one in which the heart had been too strong for the judgment she found excuses for her child and took her to her arms you must me thank you he wants to see you too added the young wife blushing at the earliest possible moment that is the worst trial we shall have to go through present and it seems to me the hardest my dear mother has been so good so indulgent we have been such companions it is terrible to deceive

shut in with this man of whom she knew so little that seemed to choke her she feared each moment that he would presume upon his to make some move that she dreaded it was very well for him to marry her that was a most convenient act but to claim the privileges that go with matrimony she felt was a far different thing however to her great joy limited his remarks to the scenes through which they were

she is a widow i believe and she has one child to whom she is attached you can see them riding out together any pleasant afternoon wait a moment she always leaves at midnight the pushed toward the
